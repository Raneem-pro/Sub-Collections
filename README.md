## ToDo List Project with Firebase

### Using Subcollections

In our ToDo list project utilizing Firebase, one structural approach involves using subcollections. Each user has a main document, and within this document, there is a subcollection of tasks. This design is advantageous as it allows for detailed task information to be stored separately and facilitates easy querying and updates of individual tasks. With subcollections, each task can be independently managed, making it ideal for applications that require complex data relationships and frequent updates to individual tasks.
